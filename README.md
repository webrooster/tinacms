## Features

### Build time

This website is build with [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) (v10) and is compiled to static html. At build time my blog posts (written in markdown) are fetched from the file system and the projects readme files are fetched from github (markdown). This information is then rendered into html using [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown)

### RSS feed

When build this sets generates an RSS feed by looking at the markdown files it has in its content folder

### TinaCMS

If you [are on the site](https://logana.dev) you will notice a button at the bottom of the page that says "See spelling errors? Click here to edit the site". When clicked this button allows one to login with there github, make new branch, and edit the sites content in github (pretty cool). Everything is editable on the site its self so no need to look at a backend CMS. Just simply edit the page inline.
